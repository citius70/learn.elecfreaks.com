# Petal Series Sensors

## Product Overview

**Petal Series**: The name "Petal" captures the core nature of our sensors. Featuring a modular design, each component functions like a petal, and together they form a complete and innovative educational ecosystem. Just like the exquisitely crafted petals in nature, every module is meticulously designed to deliver a robust, professional-grade experience for users.

## Product Features

### Color Identification System
The product is equipped with a color identification system. The colors of the sensor ports, the expansion board ports, and the software blocks in MakeCode are fully consistent, which lowers the learning barrier for students and effectively improves classroom efficiency.

### Foolproof Interface
The foolproof interface design prevents incorrect reverse insertion.

### Building Block Compatibility
The fixing interfaces of structural components are compatible with building block spacing. Sensors or expansion boards can be mounted onto building blocks using screws.
